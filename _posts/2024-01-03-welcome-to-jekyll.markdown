Hi there!

You've shown up very early to what I hope will be a decades long project.

And that's pretty awesome, so thank you!

To learn more, send a DM to **@practicingdev** or send an email to **gregory at practicingdeveloper.com** -- I'd love to answer any questions you have or just let you know more about what I'm trying to do here.

You can also [sign up for email announcements](https://skillstopractice.podia.com/) about my **Beginner's Guide to Code Reading**, if you are a beginner, beginner at heart, or looking to help others find a new and better way to start.
